# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

### Given a large amount of student and school related data, we've been tasked with analyzing student grade performace to find if there's any correlation to school funding, school size, or school type (district or charter).  Additionally, in light of potential academic dishonesty in the testing results of a specific group of students (9th graders from Thomas High School), we refactored the parameters of the analysis to make sure that per-student averages weren't unfairly weighted or erroneously skewed.
